\begin{questions}
\question Find a domain in the $z$-plane whose image under the
transformation $w=z^2$ is the square domain in the $w$-plane
bounded by the lines $u=1$, $u=2$, $v=1$, and $v=2$. (See
Section 14 in the textbook.)

\question Show that the function $\ds f(z) = \left( \frac{z}
{\bar{z}} \right)^2$ has the value $1$ at all nonzero points on
the real and imaginary axes, but that it has the value $-1$
at all nonzero points on the line $x=y$. Conclude that the
limit of $f(z)$ as $z$ tends to $0$ does not exist.

\question Let $f$ be the function defined by
\[
f(z) = 
\begin{cases}
  \bar{z}^2/z & \text{ when } z \ne 0, \\
  0 & \text{ when } z=0.
\end{cases}
\]
Show that if $z=0$, then $\Delta w / \Delta z = 1$ at each
nonzero point on the real and imaginary axes in the
$\Delta z$-plane. Then show that $\Delta w/ \Delta z = -1$ at
each nonzero point on the line $\Delta x = \Delta y$.
Conclude that $f'(0)$ does not exist. Note that to obtain this
result it is not sufficient to consider only horizontal and
vertical approaches to the origin in the $\Delta z$-plane.

\question Show from the definition of complex derivatives that
the functions $f(z) = \re z$ and $g(z) = \im z$ are not
complex differentiable at any point in the plane.

\question Using the definitions, rules for derivatives, or the
Cauchy-Riemann equations, determine where
the following functions are complex differentiable and find
$f'(z)$ where it exists.
\begin{parts}
  \part $f(z) = 1/(z^2+1)$,
  \part $f(z) = x^2 + iy^2 $,
  \part $f(z) = \sin x \cosh y - i \cos x \sinh y$,
  \part $f(z) = \sin x \cosh y + i \cos x \sinh y$.
\end{parts}
\end{questions}
